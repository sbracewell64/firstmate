# fm-fleet-view.sh - human renderer over fm-fleet-snapshot.sh.

# This command intentionally does not parse fleet state itself.
# It shells out to fm-fleet-snapshot.sh --json and renders that stable
# structured contract for humans.
#
# It inherits that command's exit-status contract: an empty fleet renders and
# exits 0, while a snapshot that failed or produced nothing exits nonzero and
# says so, because supervision reviews the fleet from this view and must never
# read a failed read as a healthy fleet.
