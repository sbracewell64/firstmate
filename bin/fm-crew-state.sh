# fm-crew-state.sh - deterministic read of a crew's CURRENT state.
#
# Why this exists: state/<id>.status is an append-only, best-effort EVENT LOG.
# Crews append only wake-worthy transitions (done/needs-decision/blocked/paused/failed)
# and nothing when they silently resume, so `tail -1` of that log reports the
# last EVENT, not the current STATE. After firstmate resolves a needs-decision
# or blocked and the crew resumes (responds to the gate, the pipeline fixes, it
# re-validates), the log's last line stays stale. This helper never infers the
# current state from a tail of the log: it reads the authoritative source (a
# no-mistakes run-step attributed to this crew's branch and current code
# identity, else the pane busy-signature) and reconciles the possibly-stale log
# against it.
#
# The determinism lives entirely here - only run-step / pane / log reads plus
# fixed mapping logic, no heuristics and no LLM. Output is one stable, parseable,
# token-tight line firstmate can read every heartbeat:
#
#   state: <state> · source: <run-step|pane|status-log|none> · <detail>
#
# `--json` emits the SAME derivation as typed fields for machine consumers, so
# no caller has to recover structure by substring-matching the prose above. The
# prose mode is unchanged and remains the default.
#
# STATE VOCABULARY. Every condition this reader can encounter has its own
# verdict; none borrows another's, because a borrowed verdict is a confident
# answer to a question the evidence did not answer:
#   working      a run step is executing, or the harness is mid-turn
#   parked       waiting at a pipeline gate for a decision
#   blocked      stopped and needs firstmate
#   paused       a declared, expected external wait
#   done         terminal success
#   failed       the pipeline JUDGED the work and rejected it
#   aborted      the run was deliberately cancelled - no verdict on the work
#   interrupted  the run died without reaching a verdict (the pipeline broke,
#                e.g. "daemon crashed during execution"); the work was never
#                judged, so this is a re-run condition, not a rejection
#   idle         endpoint alive, nothing running, and no state-bearing event
#   stale        the winning evidence exists but has aged out of validity
#   unknown      genuinely no usable evidence
# `failed` vs `aborted` vs `interrupted` and `idle` vs `stale` vs `unknown` are
# the distinctions this reader used to collapse. Collapsing them made an
# infrastructure kill read as a rejection, a deliberate abort read as a failure,
# a dead worker read as working, and an ordinary decision-closing `resolved:`
# line read as "no current-state source available".
#
# FRESHNESS. A verdict names both which source won (precedence_applied) and how
# old that evidence was (evidence_age_secs). Evidence past its bound yields
# `stale`, never a live-looking answer - the busy record in particular carries a
# timestamp that was previously parsed for format only and never compared to the
# clock (see FM_BUSY_MAX_BUSY_AGE_SECS in bin/fm-busy-lib.sh).
#
# Logic, in order:
#   1. Resolve worktree + backend target + identity axes from state/<id>.meta.
#   2. Matching no-mistakes run for this crew's branch AND current code identity,
#      active or terminal (from `axi status`, or the coarse `no-mistakes runs`
#      fallback)? Branch name alone is not enough: a historical run on a reused
#      branch whose head was rewritten or diverged must not be attributed. The
#      three-valued match/no-match/unresolvable rule is owned by
#      fm_nm_head_matches_worktree in bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh. Unresolvable is a
#      real answer here and never a terminal verdict: an active run on this
#      branch whose tip this worktree cannot see is the ordinary pre-push
#      pipeline state and reads as working, and neither it nor the coarse
#      fallback may let an older finished run stand in for the live one.
#      The run-step is AUTHORITATIVE: running/fixing -> working, ci -> working,
#      awaiting_approval/fix_review -> parked (with gate findings), terminal
#      passed/checks-passed -> done, cancelled -> aborted, and failed -> failed
#      unless the run carries positive evidence the pipeline broke without
#      judging the work, which reports interrupted
#      (nm_run_broke_without_verdict). EXCEPT: while
#      the active step is ci, `axi status` alone cannot tell "still waiting on
#      checks" from "checks green, waiting on merge" (see nm_ci_checks_state) -
#      a ci-step log-tail check overrides working -> done once checks read
#      green, so a green PR is never silently read as still-validating.
#      A terminal checks-passed is a REPORTED claim and is corroborated against
#      the run's own ci log before it is repeated: a claim the evidence does not
#      record reports blocked, because a head no check run examined is not work
#      ready for review. See nm_ci_checks_state for the measured defect.
#   3. Reconcile the status log: if its last line says needs-decision/blocked but
#      the run-step shows the run moved on, the log is deterministically stale and
#      is flagged superseded. A genuinely parked run plus a needs-decision log
#      agree, and are reported as parked.
#   4. No run for this crew (pre-validation, or deliverable=scout): fall back to the
#      recorded backend's pane busy state, then the status log's last line only
#      when its verb maps to a recognized run-state. Decision-only events such as
#      `resolved` never become current state or detail; a live endpoint whose
#      last event only closed a decision reports `idle`, not `unknown`.
#   5. Missing meta or torn-down worktree: report unknown · none. If no run is
#      attributed to this crew, a dead endpoint also reports unknown · none rather
#      than trusting a stale status log.
#
# Read-only and side-effect free. Always exits 0 on a successful read regardless
# of state; exit 2 only on a usage error (no id).

# "<status> <branch> <short-sha> <date> [<pr-url>]" separated by runs of
# spaces (verified: no quoting, so splitting on the first two whitespace runs
# is exact) - but branch + coarse status is exactly what this predicate needs:
# is a run for THIS branch active right now. Echoes the first (most recent)
# matching row's status word (running/completed/cancelled/failed), or empty
