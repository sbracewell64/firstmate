# Perform the approved local merge for a local-only ship task: fast-forward the
# project's default branch to the crewmate's fm/<id> branch.
#
# This is firstmate's merge gate-action (the captain's merge authority applied
# locally instead of via a GitHub PR). It is the one sanctioned exception to hard
# rule #1 "never run state-changing git in projects/", and it is narrow: it only
# runs for mode=local-only tasks, only after the captain approves (or yolo=on
# auto-approves), and only as a clean fast-forward - it refuses a diverged branch
# and tells you to have the crewmate rebase. See AGENTS.md prime directives,
# project management, and task lifecycle.
#
# Uncommitted work in the project blocks the merge only on a GENUINE COLLISION:
# a path that is both uncommitted in the project checkout and rewritten by this
# exact fast-forward, including an untracked entry and an incoming path that
# cannot both exist because one is a directory where the other is a file. An
# untracked directory git will not descend into, a nested repository above all,
# stands for everything beneath it, because nothing here can see what it holds. An
# untracked or modified path the fast-forward never touches cannot be clobbered
# by it, and an ignored path is declared disposable - git itself overwrites one
# without complaint, and this guard matches git rather than second-guessing it -
# so neither blocks the merge. A refusal names every colliding path and what the
# incoming commits do to it. A state this guard cannot classify confidently - an
# unresolved conflict, a merge, cherry-pick, revert, rebase, bisect, or patch
# application left in progress, an unrecognized status code, a git command that
# fails - refuses instead of proceeding, naming the operation it found and how to
# conclude or abandon it, ahead of the divergence that operation's own commits
# caused, since rebasing is not what settles it.

# operation is the reason this matters - it parks the checkout on no branch at
# all, and it commits onto the default branch as it works through its remaining
# picks. Either symptom reaches a generic check first if the order is reversed,
# and the operator is told they are on the wrong branch or that the task branch
# has diverged and should be rebased, when what they actually have to do is
# conclude or abandon the operation, which restores the default branch and makes
# the fast-forward valid again.

# --- working-tree listing ----------------------------------------------------
#
# A blanket "any uncommitted change refuses" check is stricter than git itself

# the index), because the cure sits behind the symptom. So refuse only where the
# fast-forward could actually destroy local work.
#
# Both sides are read NUL-delimited. -z is not an optimization here: it is the
# only status and diff format that emits paths verbatim instead of quoting names
# with spaces or non-ASCII bytes. --untracked-files=all is required so untracked
# entries are individual files rather than a collapsed parent directory, which
# would hide a collision at a nested path. It cannot collapse every such parent:
# a directory git will not descend into - a nested repository is the shape that
# does it - still arrives as a lone "<dir>/" entry, so the collision lookup below
# normalizes that trailing slash away and treats the entry as covering everything
# beneath it. Ignored files are absent from this listing (no --ignored), which is
