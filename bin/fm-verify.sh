#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-verify.sh - run a declared verifier and return a three-valued result, so
# that no verifier's silence, error, or absent result can be read as a pass.
#
# Exit status alone cannot carry a verification result, because it cannot
# distinguish "the verifier ran and reached a verdict" from "the verifier never
# reached one". Three real instances in this fleet:
#   - an empty GitHub check-run set read as green, because zero failing checks
#     looks exactly like all checks passing;
#   - chrome-devtools-axi printing "Protocol error (Target.setDiscoverTargets):
#     Target closed" and exiting 0, so a caller branching on exit status
#     concludes the page is fine;
#   - git merge-tree exiting 1 both for a real conflict and for a ref it cannot
#     resolve, so one exit status covers a verdict and a non-verdict.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-verify.sh [--evidence <path>] <verifier> [args...]
#   fm-verify.sh --list
#   fm-verify.sh -h | --help
#
# Options:
#   --evidence <path>  write the verifier's captured output here instead of a
#                      generated temporary file. The path must contain no comma
#                      and no newline, because it is a field of the emitted
#                      record.
#
# Declared verifiers (the registry is closed; an undeclared name is refused
# rather than run, because a name this script cannot interpret is a name whose
# output it cannot judge):
#   browser <subcommand> [args...]
#       Runs chrome-devtools-axi with the given arguments. This adapter never
#       returns FAIL, and that is deliberate rather than an omission:
#       chrome-devtools-axi is a control tool, not an assertion tool, so it has
#       no way to report "the page is bad" - only "here is what I saw" or a
#       failure to see it. The verdict on what it saw belongs to the caller.
#   pr-checks <pr-url>
#       Reads the pull request's check-run set through gh and classifies it with
#       bin/fm-verify-lib.sh.
#   merge-clean <base-ref> <head-ref> [repo-dir]
#       Runs git merge-tree --write-tree in <repo-dir> (default: the current
#       directory).
#
# Output is exactly one record on stdout, in every case:
#
#   verify[1]{verifier,result,reason,evidence_ref}:
#     browser,NO_VERIFIER_RAN,verification_unreachable,/tmp/fm-verify-browser.abc123.log
#
# result is one of:
#   PASS            the verifier ran, reached a verdict, and the verdict is good
#   FAIL            the verifier ran and reached a verdict, and it is bad
#   NO_VERIFIER_RAN no verdict was reached. Never a pass, never a failure of the
#                   subject, and never skippable.
#
# reason is one of this closed vocabulary:
#   verified                  PASS
#   verifier_reported_failure FAIL
#   verifier_undeclared       the verifier name is not in the registry
#   verifier_unavailable      the underlying tool is not installed
#   verification_unreachable  the verifier ran but could not reach its subject
#                             (ruling D3's token for the unreachable browser)
#   empty_result_set          the verifier returned no results at all
#   verification_incomplete   results exist but no verdict has been reached yet
#   no_verdict_reached        the verifier finished and reached no verdict, and
#                             none is coming: checks that completed TIMED_OUT,
#                             CANCELLED, ACTION_REQUIRED, SKIPPED, STALE,
#                             NEUTRAL, or with no conclusion at all
#   no_evidence               the verifier's output could not be captured
#   usage_error               the call itself was malformed
#
# Exit status: 0 for PASS and ONLY for PASS; 1 for FAIL; 2 for NO_VERIFIER_RAN.
# That mapping is the enforcement, not a convenience: a caller writing
# `if fm-verify.sh ...; then` gets the fail-closed answer by construction, so
# NO_VERIFIER_RAN cannot reach a pass terminal even in a caller that reads
# nothing but the status.
#
# TOOLING_GAP - chrome-devtools-axi reports transport failures on stdout while
# exiting 0. Until it exits non-zero, the browser adapter has to recognize those
# failures by their text, and the signature list below is deliberately biased:
# a false NO_VERIFIER_RAN costs one re-run, a false PASS is the defect this
# script exists to prevent. The durable fix belongs upstream in that tool, not
# in a longer list here.
