#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-commitment-register.sh - the typed register of RECORDED-BUT-NOT-YET-REAL
# commitments, and the only interpreter of commitments/ and of the pinned probe
# block in a decision file.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A commitment recorded with no enforcement probe reads as
# protection while protecting nothing. This fleet hit that failure four separate
# ways in one day: a captain ruling recorded and never enforced; a guard believed
# to close an inversion that has no runtime caller at all; a derived-state row
# that went stale inside a hand-maintained literal while being trusted; and a
# dated exception that self-expired into prose and was saved by a human filing a
# reminder rather than by any structure. Each was found by a person looking. None
# would have surfaced on its own.
#
# So an entry here carries a PROBE, and the probe is the load-bearing field. The
# entry's state is computed from that probe on every read and is never stored:
#
#   SATISFIED   the probe passed. The entry retires - it stops being surfaced,
#               with no hand edit. A register that needs hand-maintenance is the
#               defect it was built to fix.
#   UNMET       the probe reached a verdict and the commitment is not real yet.
#   UNOBSERVED  the probe reached no verdict, the entry is inadmissible, or the
#               entry is attested rather than probed. Three values, as everywhere
#               else in this fleet: could-not-observe is a real result, and it is
#               never read as enforced.
#
# THREE ENTRY CLASSES, two producers.
#
#   ruling_not_enforced      a ruling is recorded and nothing enforces it
#   authorisation_not_owned  authorised work has no owner
#         Both are JSON entries under commitments/ or the home overlay, and both
#         declare a TYPED probe (see probe_kinds in commitments/schema.json).
#         Typed rather than a raw command because the tracked register ships to
#         every home and a shared file must never become a shell-execution seam.
#
#   ruled_finding_not_met    a review finding was ruled, a fix was reported
#         APPLIED, and nothing establishes that the criterion is MET. Applied is
#         an action; met is a predicate, and a pipeline only ever knows the action
#         happened. These are NOT hand-registered here: the captain ruling of
#         2026-08-10 (data/captain-rulings-2026-08-10/ruled-criterion-must-carry-a-probe.md)
#         pins the probe into the decision file firstmate already writes, at
#         $FM_HOME/data/<task-id>/decision-<key>.md, as exactly one fenced block:
#
#             ```probe
#             tier: executable | cited-control | attested
#             run: <command, run from the task worktree; exit 0 means met>
#             control: <name of the test or artifact watched to fail first>
#             reason: <required for tier attested only - why no probe is possible>
#             ```
#
#         The format is pinned so what firstmate writes and what this file reads
#         cannot drift, which is why this register discovers those probes rather
#         than asking anyone to copy them into a second place.
#
# THE TIERS are the ruling's three, shared by both producers, because forcing a
# probe where none is possible would recreate this same failure one level up:
#   executable     the probe runs directly and its result is the answer.
#   cited-control  the probe confirms a named test exists and passes NOW, while
#                  the watched-it-fail observation is cited as a named artifact
#                  rather than a claim. The DEFAULT: the strongest routinely
#                  achievable form. The ruling pins `control` as a NAME, so it is
#                  surfaced and marked when it also resolves on disk, never gated
#                  on - what no mechanism can confirm is that the cited artifact
#                  records a real red observation, which is why the tier is
#                  "cited" rather than "verified".
#   attested       the criterion genuinely cannot execute. It carries a reason,
#                  declares no probe, and NEVER reaches SATISFIED: it stays marked
#                  and visible rather than being read as verified.
#
# NO BACK-FILLING. A decision key ruled before 2026-08-10 carries no probe block,
# and none is invented for it: it simply has no registered probe, so the fold
# below behaves for it exactly as it always did, and this register reports its
# criterion as could-not-observe rather than manufacturing evidence. A fabricated
# record is indistinguishable from a real one afterwards.
#
# NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR DILIGENCE. Every instance this register was built from was
# caught by a worker re-checking its own work. The probe is a floor beneath that,
# never a substitute, and a green entry licenses nothing.
#
# TRUST BOUNDARY. A decision file's `run:` is executed. Those files are
# firstmate-written, home-private, gitignored material in the operational home
# this command was pointed at - the same trust class as the rest of $FM_HOME/data.
# The tracked register deliberately has no such field: it ships between homes, and
# a shared file that could execute would be a different thing entirely.
#
# Three-valued results are produced and consumed through bin/fm-verify-lib.sh, so
# no probe's silence, error, or empty answer can reach a pass terminal.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT bin/fm-decision-surface.sh, said plainly. That script is this
# fleet's derived-state composer and its typed verdicts are the right shape, and
# fm-verify-lib.sh's three-valued observation type is used here rather than
# reinvented. The decision surface still does not fit as the host, for three
# reasons that are properties of the input rather than preferences:
#   1. Different input class. The decision surface composes ONE home's live
#      operational state - tasks, holds, wake ledger - through
#      bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh. This reads TRACKED repository material that ships
#      to every home and answers about the code itself, and it must answer
#      identically in a home that has no tasks, no snapshot, and no fleet at all.
#   2. Different call site and cost budget. The decision surface is invoked by a
#      human or a composer once; --closes runs inside bin/fm-classify-lib.sh's
#      open-decision fold, on the wake-drain path, per resolved status line.
#      Putting that on a composer that loads a fleet snapshot first would make the
#      fold pay for state it does not read.
#   3. Different failure obligation. A commitment that cannot be evaluated must
#      take a fail-closed EXIT STATUS a caller ignoring stdout still stops on. The
#      decision surface reports; it is not a gate.
# What the decision surface does own is the fact that this compensation now has an
# owner at all: its owners ledger carries the unenforced_commitments row pointing
# here, so the two surfaces are joined rather than parallel.
#
# WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT TOUCH. It takes no lock and touches no project. It
# does NOT execute anything from the tracked register, which is the whole reason
# that register's probes are typed. It DOES execute three things, all of them
# home-private or repo-local: a decision file's `run:` (see TRUST BOUNDARY above),
# an entry's declared owner command, and an entry's named test. The only thing it
# writes is the decision-probe result cache described under Environment below.
# Because a `run:` executes inside the task worktree, a probe that writes scratch
# files there leaves that worktree dirty, which bin/fm-teardown.sh's dirty check
# then refuses on - a `run:` that mutates its worktree is a badly written probe,
# and the cache bounds how often it runs but cannot make it harmless.
#
# TWO KINDS OF PROBE, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME QUESTION. Conflating them is what
# produced both the original hazard and the first, over-broad attempt at fixing
# it, so the distinction is written here rather than left to be re-derived:
#
#   The register's OWN TYPED probes are a CLOSED set defined in this file and
#   named by kind in commitments/schema.json. This repository owns every one of
#   them, can audit what each does, and bounds each at 10s. Running one is a COST
#   decision, and the cost is small and known.
#
#   A decision file's `run:` is ARBITRARY TEXT written by whoever authored a
#   ruling, executed by `bash -c` inside a task worktree. Running one is a TRUST
#   decision, and no bound makes it a small one.
#
# They must not share a switch, because a switch that answers the trust question
# would silence the cost one too.
#
# That first paragraph is only true because of probe_target_fault below: the
# KINDS are closed, but the TARGETS they run come out of the entry's own JSON,
# and an entry can arrive from the gitignored home overlay. Every path a typed
# probe names is therefore resolved only under the tracked code root - no
# absolute path, no upward traversal, and no symlinked target at all, wherever it
# points, because what a symlink resolves to is not what this register audited -
# and an entry naming one is inadmissible rather than executed. Without that, "this
# repository owns every one of them" would be a hope rather than a property, and
# the cost argument for running typed probes at session start would not hold.
#
# SESSION START RUNS TYPED PROBES AND NEVER A DECISION-FILE `run:`. The arbitrary-
# execution chain is real and it is specific: bin/fm-session-start.sh runs
# bin/fm-admission.sh, which runs bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh, which calls
# status_open_decisions per task, which reaches the closure gate below - which
# would otherwise `bash -c` a ruling author's text inside a task worktree on the
# critical path of every session. That is the FOLD. It is not the --open relay:
# --open never collects decision probes at all, deliberately, because the fold is
# their surface. So bin/fm-session-start.sh sets
# FM_COMMITMENT_NO_DECISION_RUN=1 on exactly the calls that reach the fold - its
# wake drain, its admission read, its bootstrap relay and its deferred network
# stage - and on nothing else; tests/fm-session-start.test.sh DERIVES that set
# rather than pinning a list, because it grows whenever a script session start
# already invokes gains a fold read. The variable is
# never exported over session start's whole subtree, because that subtree
# relaunches secondmates through bin/fm-spawn.sh, which scrubs no environment: a
# safety flag that escaped into a long-lived agent would silently wedge closure
# there for that agent's whole life.
#
# The typed probes keep running at session start, which is what lets an entry
# whose commitment became real retire there with no hand edit. Suppressing them
# would leave every registered entry printing forever, and a session start that
# cries wolf is one that gets turned off - the same end the safety rule exists to
# prevent.
#
# NOT RUNNING IS NOT ACCEPTING. When a decision `run:` is not executed, no stored
# verdict stands in for it either - serving a cached PASS would close a key on an
# observation this session did not make - so the answer is could-not-observe, the
# resolution stays visibly unverified, and the fold keeps showing the decision.
# Fail-open here would be worse than the cost it avoids. A wake drain, a
# decision-hold read, or a fleet snapshot run OUTSIDE session start sets no such
# variable and evaluates decision probes normally; session start's own wake drain
# and admission read are inside the guard and report those keys as still open.
#
# WHAT THIS SUPERSEDES, recorded rather than quietly rewritten, because the
# reasoning is the part worth inheriting. The rule was first accepted in the
# blanket form "SESSION START MUST EXECUTE NO PROBE - session start may report
# RECORDED state; it may never execute a probe to find out." Built that way it
# defeated the criterion it shares a page with: with no probe running, nothing at
# session start is ever SATISFIED, so every registered entry prints a
# could-not-observe line forever and never retires when its commitment becomes
# real - the cry-wolf outcome the safety rule exists to prevent, since a session
# start that always shouts is one that gets turned off. The rule is therefore
# narrowed to its hazard: the guard covers decision-file `run:` EXECUTION only.
# Typed probes remain permitted at session start precisely because their targets
# are constrained to the tracked code root, which is what makes them a cost
# question rather than a trust one; if that constraint is ever relaxed, this
# permission has to be reconsidered with it. commitments/schema.json carries the
# same supersession under probe_bounds.
#
# bin/fm-bootstrap.sh relays --open at every session start, so session
# start cannot report a clean or quiet state while a registered commitment is open,
# and bin/fm-classify-lib.sh's open-decision fold calls --closes so a reported-
# applied fix cannot close a criterion nothing established.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-commitment-register.sh [--json]
#       Every entry - both JSON classes and every discovered decision probe -
#       with its computed state and the evidence behind it.
#   fm-commitment-register.sh <id> [--json]
#       One entry. A discovered decision probe's id is decision:<task>:<key>.
#   fm-commitment-register.sh --open
#       One complete "COMMITMENT: ..." line per REGISTERED entry that is not
#       SATISFIED, in the form bin/fm-bootstrap.sh relays verbatim. Silent when
#       every registered entry is satisfied. Never suppressed by age, count, or
#       rate: a quieter question hides a genuine unmet commitment along with the
#       noise. Discovered decision probes are deliberately NOT relayed here - the
#       open-decision fold is their surface, and this adds no second one.
#   fm-commitment-register.sh --closes <task-id> <decision-key>
#       May a `resolved` event for this keyed decision be accepted? Exits 0 when
#       no probe is registered for the key, when its probe passes, or when it is
#       an attested criterion (whose acceptance is printed, never silent), and
#       non-zero otherwise with one line of evidence.
#   Any report may be combined with --no-decision-run, which is
#       FM_COMMITMENT_NO_DECISION_RUN=1 as a flag: execute no decision file's
#       `run:` and report every such criterion as could-not-observe rather than
#       finding out. The register's own typed probes are unaffected. See TWO KINDS
#       OF PROBE above.
#   fm-commitment-register.sh --help
#
# Exit status is the verdict, so a caller that ignores stdout still stops safely:
#   0  every entry is SATISFIED (or, for --closes, the resolution is accepted)
#   2  usage error
#   3  at least one entry is UNMET, and none is UNOBSERVED
#   4  at least one entry is UNOBSERVED - including a register that could not be
#      read at all, which is never a quiet pass
#
# Entries are read from three places, and a JSON id must be unique across the two
# JSON sources:
#   commitments/<id>.json                tracked; commitments about this repo's own
#                                        shared code, shipped to every home. Its
#                                        absence is UNOBSERVED, not silence: the
#                                        directory ships with bin/, so a missing
#                                        one means the register is not working.
#   $FM_HOME/data/commitments/<id>.json  optional home overlay for captain-private
#                                        commitments that must not reach a shared
#                                        template repo. Its absence is silent.
#   $FM_HOME/data/<task>/decision-<key>.md  discovered ruled-finding probes.
#
# Environment:
#   FM_HOME                       operational home to read (default: repo root)
#   FM_COMMITMENT_DIR             read this tracked register instead (tests)
#   FM_COMMITMENT_HOME_DIR        read this home overlay instead (tests)
#   FM_COMMITMENT_NO_DECISION_RUN 1 to execute no decision file's `run:` and
#                                 report every such criterion as could-not-observe
#                                 (default 0). The register's own typed probes are
#                                 unaffected. Set by bin/fm-session-start.sh on the
#                                 two calls that reach the open-decision fold, and
#                                 on nothing else; see TWO KINDS OF PROBE above.
#   FM_COMMITMENT_PROBE_TIMEOUT   seconds bounding one register-entry probe
#                                 (default 10)
#   FM_COMMITMENT_DECISION_PROBE_TIMEOUT
#                                 seconds bounding one decision-file `run:`
#                                 (default 60)
#   FM_COMMITMENT_PROBE_CACHE_TTL seconds a decision-probe result stays servable
#                                 (default 120; 0 disables the cache entirely)
#   FM_COMMITMENT_PROBE_CACHE_DIR where those results live (default
#                                 $FM_HOME/state/commitment-probe-cache)
#
# THE TWO PROBE BOUNDS, both stated wherever either is, because prose claiming
# what the code does not do is the failure this whole file is about. The register's
# OWN typed probes are bounded at 10s: they read this repository, and none of them
# is a test invocation. A decision file's `run:` is bounded at 60s, and that number
# is derived rather than picked. The 2026-08-10 ruling makes cited-control the
# DEFAULT tier and its `run` is a test invocation, so the bound has to let the
# pinned default finish or it refuses every such closure forever, which is a park
# rather than a verdict. Measured on the machine this was written on:
# tests/fm-commitment-register.test.sh runs in 7.8s (three runs: 7.82, 7.82, 7.81),
# and a pinned cited-control probe invokes that suite TWICE - once per grep in the
# `run` - so one probe costs about 15.6s. 60s is therefore roughly 4x observed with
# headroom for machine load, and that ratio is what the next person changing this
# number is trading. commitments/schema.json carries the same two numbers and the
# same derivation under probe_bounds, and a test pins them equal.
#
# A PROBE THAT TIMES OUT IS REPORTED AS A TIMEOUT, distinct from every other
# could-not-observe cause. Could-not-observe is safe because it can never wrongly
# pass, but it also cannot close a key, so a chronically timing-out probe would
# otherwise block a closure forever while reading as an ordinary open item. Its
# evidence therefore leads with TIMEOUT and names the bound, so someone fixes the
# probe rather than wondering why a key will not close.
#
# THE DECISION-PROBE CACHE, and the one rule it may not break. --closes runs on
# the open-decision fold's hot path, which recomputes from the whole status stream
# on every wake drain, every fleet snapshot, and every decision-hold read - so an
# uncached probe re-runs a test for the remaining life of a status file, once per
# fold, per task. The cache bounds that. It may not buy the cost back with the
# correctness this register exists to establish, so:
#   - a served result CARRIES ITS OBSERVATION TIME in its own evidence, so an old
#     answer can never read as a fresh one, and bin/fm-classify-lib.sh surfaces
#     that evidence on the ACCEPT path too rather than discarding it;
#   - it is keyed on what the probe's answer actually DEPENDS on: the decision
#     file's bytes, the task worktree, and that worktree's head. Deliberately NOT
#     on the task status file, because the open-decision fold is DRIVEN by status
#     appends - keying on those would invalidate the entry precisely on the append
#     where the cache was meant to help, while a worktree whose head moved past the
#     recorded verdict would still be answered from before;
#   - past the freshness bound it is not served at all: the probe re-runs, and if
#     it cannot re-run the answer is could-not-observe, never the stale verdict.
# The cache is an accelerator for an answer, never a substitute for one.

# --- typed-probe targets live under the tracked code root --------------------

# The probe KINDS are a closed set; the TARGETS they run are not. command, test
# and defined_in come out of the entry's own JSON, and entries arrive from the
# gitignored $FM_HOME/data/commitments/ overlay as well as from the tracked
# register - so without this, one unreviewed file could name any absolute
# executable and have it run on the critical path of every session in the fleet.
# That is a trust decision reached through the door labelled cost, which is
# exactly the conflation TWO KINDS OF PROBE says must not happen. Constraining
# targets to the tracked code root is what makes "this repository owns every one
# of them" true rather than nearly true, and it is the reason typed probes are
# allowed to run at session start at all.
#
# Prints one refusal reason, or nothing when the target is admissible. An ABSENT
# target is not refused: an owner or test that does not exist is an OBSERVED
# absence, and reporting it as unobservable would hide the very thing the entry
