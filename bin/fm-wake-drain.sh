# Raw output and queue deletion are authoritative. Everything below is
# best-effort and cannot restore, duplicate, hide, or fail the consumed rows.

# Supervision latency and drain depth. Each queue record carries the epoch at
# which the watcher enqueued it, but nothing recorded when firstmate actually
# consumed it, so the delay between an event happening and the coordinator
# acting on it - the most direct expression of coordinator attention cost - had
# no series at all. Depth is the DEDUPED record count, the number of distinct
# wakes this turn must handle: the raw queue coalesces repeat records per key,
# so a raw count reads high against what firstmate is really handed. Latency is
# the age of the oldest record in that deduped set. Written to the same bounded
# log the watcher uses, from the same writer, at drain cadence (a few times an
# hour), strictly after the authoritative consumption boundary above.
