# Kimi is verified for crewmate and secondmate launches only. It is NOT in
# FM_HARNESS_PRIMARY, which is why there is no docs/supervision-protocols/kimi.md
# and no kimi arm in bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh. Those absences are
# correct; do not "fix" them from this adapter's existence.

# Kimi's Stop hook is globally configured but inert unless the working directory
# holds this per-task token pointer and the token resolves through firstmate's
# private registry - the same guarded shape Grok uses.
