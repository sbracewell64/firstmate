#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-ruling-reconcile.sh - deterministic, model-free prefilter that reconciles
# this home's ruling documents against its OPEN captain decision holds.
#
# Why this exists: a captain answers a decision in a ruling document and the
# hold that asked the question stays queued. The register then re-asks answered
# questions and investigations inherit stale premises. Nothing read the ruling
# back onto the hold, so the reconciliation was done by hand, repeatedly, by
# re-reading ruling prose on every bearings and every investigation.
#
# This script answers only the deterministic part: which open captain hold is
# named, verbatim, in which ruling document, at which line, next to which
# explicit verdict token. It reaches the `no_delta` terminal without opening a
# ruling document at all when nothing that could change the answer has changed.
#
# It NEVER grades and NEVER closes. Grading an excerpt as rules / commissions /
# cites / defers requires classifying natural language, which is the caller's
# work. Closing a hold is the captain's authority, exercised through
# bin/fm-decision-hold.sh resolve. This script produces evidence and an
# eligibility verdict; .agents/skills/decision-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md owns the
# surrounding decision policy.
#
# THE CLOSURE RULE THIS SCRIPT ENFORCES (captain ruling, 2026-08-06, option c):
# a hold may be closed on the strength of a ruling only when BOTH hold - the
# ruling document names the hold identifier VERBATIM, and the ruling carries an
# EXPLICIT VERDICT TOKEN. Everything else escalates. A hold named in a
# commission rather than a ruling is never eligible. Both conditions together
# are NECESSARY AND NOT SUFFICIENT: eligibility still requires a caller grade of
# `rules`, and closure is still performed by fm-decision-hold.sh, never here.
# The error direction is deliberate - a document class or verdict token this
# script cannot recognise escalates to a human, and can never close a hold.
#
# The derived index lives under the home's existing volatile-state owner
# ($FM_HOME/state/ruling-index). Deleting the whole index is always safe; the
# next scan rebuilds it deterministically from the canonical sources. The index
# is derived, never authority: decision truth stays in the ruling documents and
# hold truth stays in the backlog.

#                                --grade <rules|commissions|cites|defers>
#                                apply the captain's two-condition closure rule
#                                to one graded excerpt and print the permitted
#                                fm-decision-hold.sh command, or escalate

# The explicit-verdict vocabulary. A token counts only inside single-line
# markdown emphasis (**...**), which is how this home's ruling tables record a
# verdict, so ordinary prose that merely discusses a decision does not qualify.
#
# The set is tuned for PRECISION, not recall, because the two error directions
# are not symmetric. A verdict this set misses escalates to a human, which costs
# a read. A non-verdict this set accepts weakens the captain's condition 2
# toward vacuity, which is the "brittle regex replacing judgment" failure this
# increment exists to avoid. Common English words were therefore removed after
# measurement: `OPTION` matched the attribution span
# `**Captain, 2026-08-06, choosing option (c) verbatim:**`, and `RUN` matches
# ordinary instruction prose (`**Run the migration**`) as a whole word, so
# anchoring cannot rescue it. Structural emphasis in this corpus
# (`**Captain, verbatim:**`, `**One owner:**`, `**not met**`) matches nothing
# here, which is the intended behaviour.
#
# A token is matched as a WHOLE WORD, never as a substring of a longer one, and
# only a verb inflection may follow it. Without that anchoring the set accepts
# any emphasised word that merely CONTAINS a token - `**Runtime**` for `RUN`,
# `**sparkline**` for `PARK`, `**acceptable**` for `ACCEPT`, `**adoption**` for
# `ADOPT` - which is precisely the condition-2 vacuity this set exists to avoid.
# The inflection tail keeps the intended readings (`**ADOPTED**`, `**PARKED**`,
# `**REPLACED**`) while refusing the accidental ones.
#
# Recall is deliberately NOT tuned up to a target count. On this home's flagship
# ruling table the set recognised 15 of 24 rows when measured, an upper bound now
# that tokens are whole-word anchored; the other nine state their verdict without
# emphasis ("Replace the fictional cap of 3 with an **enforced ceiling of 10**"
# emphasises the ceiling, not the verb) and therefore escalate.
# Widening the vocabulary until it reproduced a hoped-for number would be the
# exact failure this increment exists to avoid.
#
# Both conditions together remain NECESSARY AND NOT SUFFICIENT: a match makes a
# row eligible for grading, never closed.

# that rules `sample-review-decision-alpha-two`. The index scan and the closure
# gate share this one pattern so they can never disagree about what verbatim
# means.
#
# A dot is legal inside a hold id, so it has to be excluded from the boundary to
# keep `a.b` from standing in for a line that names `a.b.c`. Excluding it
# outright, though, refused every prose naming that ends in a full stop, and the
# hold was then reported `unmatched: no ruling document names this hold`. A
# silent false-unmatch is the exact failure this increment exists to eliminate:
# it tells the reader nothing names the hold and the reader believes it, so
# "safe for closure" is not a sufficient bar when the scan's whole job is to

# Document class, decided structurally rather than by loose substring, because
# this corpus contains both a ruling ABOUT a commission
# (captain-rulings-2026-08-04-commission-32.md) and a commission INSIDE a
# rulings directory (captain-rulings-2026-08-06/cfvc-remediation-commission.md).
# Naming carries the class in two stable positions: a ruling declares itself in
# the `<who>-rulings-<when>` PREFIX form, evaluated only over the leading one or
# two dash-separated segments, and a commission declares itself in the
# `<what>commission.md` SUFFIX form. The directory is a third, weaker signal.
#
# THE IMPLEMENTED ORDER IS SUFFIX, THEN PREFIX, THEN DIRECTORY, AND IT MUST NOT
# BE REORDERED. The commission suffix is decisive and is therefore tested first:
# a document that ends in `commission.md` is a commission however much its name
# resembles a ruling elsewhere. That order can only ever bias a name toward
# `commission`, and a commission escalates rather than closes, so it fails safe
# by construction. Testing the ruling prefix first would let a commission-suffixed
# name classify as a ruling and satisfy the captain's condition 1, which is the
# exact inversion this two-position design exists to prevent - do not "correct"
# the order back. The prefix form is anchored for the same reason: an unanchored
# `*ruling-*` matches `cfvc-remediation-ruling-commission.md` and makes the
# commission branch unreachable. The directory is consulted last and only when
# the name itself declares nothing. Anything else is `other` and escalates, so an
# unrecognised naming convention costs a human read and can never close a hold.

# --- propose ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The grading envelope: schema header, then rows. Every row is an excerpt a
# caller must READ and grade. No row carries a grade, because this script does
# not grade; `grade` is emitted as `ungraded` and stays that way until a caller
# supplies one to closure-test.
#
# The excerpt and the verdict token are the two cells whose content comes from
# the ruling document, and an excerpt is a markdown table row, which routinely
# contains commas. They are therefore RFC 4180 double-quoted so the declared
# nine-field row stays honest; the column order is fixed by the schema and does
# not move.

An unmatched hold gets one matches.tsv row with ruling_file=none and
eligibility=escalate. It is reported open, never dropped.

Invalidation: the index is current only when both fingerprints match and both
inventories are byte-identical. Any hold or ruling change forces a rescan.

Empty-set law: a ruling-class document that cannot be read yields
verdict=NO_RULING_READ and exit 3, and a tasks-axi hold listing that fails
yields verdict=NO_HOLD_READ and exit 3. No index is published in either case,
because "unmatched" must never rest on a ruling nobody read and open_holds=0
must never rest on a backlog nobody could list.
