# Every firstmate-launched agent session composes its command from exactly these
# three functions. There is no second copy anywhere, and a caller must never
# hand-write a launch string: the drift that causes is not hypothetical. A
# downstream registry once hand-copied claude's command as
# `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`, dropping the ghost-text suppression
# variable documented in launch_template() below - the exact omission that makes
# firstmate read predicted-prompt text as real typed input when it captures a
# pane. One owner, or that happens again.
#
# Sourced by bin/fm-spawn.sh (crewmate, scout, and secondmate sessions).

# The verified launch command per adapter, as a template. A non-zero return has
# two distinct causes, and a caller reporting the refusal must tell them apart:
#   1. the harness has no verified adapter at all - the unverified-adapter guard
#      every caller relies on, whose remedy is a raw launch command;
#   2. the harness is verified but this kind is deliberately unsupported for it -
#      today only kimi with kind=primary, whose remedy is a different harness,
#      NOT the raw-launch escape hatch.
# Never add a permissive default arm to either case. bin/fm-spawn.sh:437 and :441
# name only cause 1 because fm-spawn never passes kind=primary; a consumer that
# does pass it owes the user the cause-2 wording.
#
# kind selects the session shape:
#   ship|scout   a crewmate working one task in an isolated worktree
#   secondmate   a firstmate PRIMARY launched in a provisioned secondmate home
#   primary      a firstmate PRIMARY launched in this home by the fleet launcher
#
# ship, scout, and secondmate all receive a launch brief, so their templates end
# in the encoded brief argument. A primary has no task, no worktree, no brief,
# and no status file, so it launches bare and is greeted by the session-start
# adapters already installed in the home (for pi and opencode those are the
# project-local extensions the harness auto-discovers once trusted, which is why
# a primary needs no explicit extension flag). A primary template therefore
# carries only its flag placeholders plus whatever briefless-launch flag that
# adapter was verified to need, and an unset flag leaves one trailing space; that
# is cosmetic in a shell command, and consumers may trim it.
#
# Placeholders every caller substitutes before launch:
#   __MODELFLAG__  model_flag_for_harness output, or empty (see below)
#   __EFFORTFLAG__ effort_flag_for_harness output, or empty (see below)
#   __KIMIBIN__    shell-quoted absolute path to the resolved kimi binary
# Placeholders only a task-scoped (ship|scout|secondmate) launch substitutes:
#   __BRIEF__     absolute path to data/<task-id>/brief.md
#   __TURNEND__   absolute path to state/<task-id>.turn-ended (for harnesses whose
#                 turn-end signal rides the launch command, e.g. codex -c notify=[...])
#   __PIEXT__     absolute path to state/<task-id>.pi-ext.ts (pi turn-end extension,
#                 written by fm-spawn.sh; outside the worktree to avoid pi's trust gate)
#   __PITURNEND__ absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts in a pi secondmate home
#   __PIWATCH__   absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts in a pi secondmate home
#   __OPINPUT__   absolute path to the canonical operational-input encoder
#
# __KIMIBIN__ is resolved by bin/fm-spawn.sh alone, deliberately: the fleet
# launcher reaches Kimi through the pi harness rather than a native kimi binary,
# so there is no second caller to drift from.
# Revisit that only if a native kimi launch ever becomes a launcher entry.
# That same reasoning is why kimi has no primary arm: only bin/fm-spawn.sh can
# substitute __KIMIBIN__, and it only ever launches crewmates, so a primary kimi
# template could not be substituted by the caller that would ask for it.
#
# No primary template below is the crewmate command with its brief argument
# subtracted; each arm cites the specific in-repo evidence that fixes its flags,
# and tests/fm-launch-lib.test.sh pins each one against those same citations.
# The evidence is not uniform, and each arm says which kind it rests on: opencode
# and grok are pinned to an empirical briefless PRIMARY launch in a live e2e test,
# pi to the documented bare launch, and claude and codex to the secondmate
# precedent - this file's own `secondmate` kind is a firstmate PRIMARY (see the
# kind list above), and its shipped crewmate templates - the claude arm and the
# codex `kind = secondmate` arm in the second case block below - launch that
# interactive primary with exactly the autonomy flags those two arms carry.
#
# CONSUMER OBLIGATION (binding, not advisory). The rule, which governs whatever
# the templates below happen to say: EVERY primary template here starts a session
# that runs without permission prompts, and a consumer composing a primary launch
# MUST surface that to the captain at launch time. One short line at launch or in
# the menu row is enough. The captain is entitled to know the posture of the
# session their front door starts. There are no exempt adapters. The rule binds on
# the posture, not on the presence of a particular flag, so a consumer cannot
# satisfy the letter of this note while silently shipping a no-prompt session.
#
# All five reach that posture, four by an explicit bypass and one structurally:
#   claude    --dangerously-skip-permissions
#   codex     --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
#   opencode  OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT='{"permission":{"*":"allow"}}', which
#             pre-allows every permission before the TUI starts
#   grok      --always-approve, which .agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md:304
#             records as auto-approving every tool execution, verified to run
#             fully unattended and equivalent to --permission-mode bypassPermissions
#   pi        no flag, because none exists to pass: SKILL.md:272 records that pi has
#             no permission system at all, so a pi session is autonomous by
#             construction. Its bare template is complete, NOT missing an autonomy
#             flag its siblings carry - do not add one.
# Pi's first-run project trust dialog (SKILL.md:276-278) is folder trust, not a
# permission prompt, and is a separate concern that neither satisfies nor softens
# this obligation.
