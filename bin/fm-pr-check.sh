# Record a PR-ready task: store one validated canonical pr=<url> and the forge's
# exact pr_head=<sha> when available, then atomically arm a static merge poll.
# The watcher check source is byte-for-byte bin/fm-pr-poll.sh; task and PR data
# live only in a private sidecar and are never interpolated into shell source.
# A GitHub pull request URL and a GitLab merge request URL are both accepted,
# including a merge request on a self-hosted GitLab instance.
#
# The identity record this writes into is the task's meta while the task is
# live, and the durable landing record bin/fm-teardown.sh leaves behind once the
# task is released with its request still unlanded, so releasing a worker before
# its request lands no longer ends the watch. When neither exists - a task
# released before landing records did - the record is rebuilt from a forge read
# of the request itself. An existing landing record must be valid and name the
# requested URL before any forge read or poll mutation. A request the forge
# cannot resolve refuses instead.
#
# A request whose venue contradicts the task's recorded contribution_venue= is
# refused before anything is armed, because on a fork layout a pull request
# raised at the wrong trunk contributes every commit the two trunks do not
# share. A task that recorded no venue is reported as unchecked and still armed;
# the absence of a record is never read as agreement. A recorded venue addressed
# through an SSH host alias is the same venue spelled differently, so the alias
# is resolved before anything is called a contradiction.
#
# Once the watch is armed, this is also the fleet's publication chokepoint for
# the head-bound no-mistakes attestation. Where the task's local copy declares a
# CI gate that reads one, bin/fm-attest.sh is delegated to publish the evidence
# its own pipeline run produced and to have that head's verdict re-derived;
# where no such gate is declared, nothing is touched. It reports one
# three-valued `attestation:` line and never changes this script's exit status,
# because a provenance answer must not undo an armed watch.

# VENUE GUARD - the recorded contribution venue against the venue this pull
# request is actually at. bin/fm-spawn.sh derives the record from the task's
# contribution target (bin/fm-task-base-lib.sh owns that derivation), so this
# refuses the case that keeps recurring on a fork layout: work based on one
# trunk raised as a pull request against the other, which contributes every
# commit the two trunks do not share.
#
# Three-valued on purpose, and only a CONTRADICTION refuses. A task with no
# recorded venue - one spawned before this record existed, or a durable landing
# record, which carries only landing identity - is UNEVALUABLE, and an
# unevaluable venue is reported rather than read as agreement. Nothing here
# infers a venue from the pull request itself; that would make the guard agree
# with whatever it was shown.
#
# The recorded venue is derived from a git remote URL, which may address the
# forge through an SSH HOST ALIAS - `git@gh-work:owner/repo`, the ordinary way
# one machine addresses two accounts at the same forge - while the pull request
# is always at the forge's real host. That is one venue written two ways, not a
# contradiction, so the recorded contribution_venue_url= is also compared with
# its alias resolved. It is an ADDITIONAL accepted spelling and never a
# replacement: the owner and repository still have to agree, so the fork-versus-
# upstream contradiction this guard exists for is refused either way. The
# resolution reads the local ssh configuration, so it runs only in the one
# branch that needs it - never for a task with no venue, the unresolved
# sentinel, or a venue that already matches literally.

# PROVENANCE CHOKEPOINT - publish the head-bound evidence the delivery boundary
# itself demands, at the one moment a validated candidate is known to exist.
#
# Where a repository's CI reads a head-bound attestation, the evidence is
# produced by the pipeline and published by bin/fm-attest.sh. Publication had no
# owner: nothing in this repository invoked it, so it happened only when someone
# remembered a line of prose. Every lane where nobody did left a candidate whose
# pipeline had completed review, test, lint and push for that exact commit
# sitting red at the boundary, indistinguishable from one that was never
# validated at all, and the repair needed a person. This is the step that closes
# it, and it runs here because this is the first point at which the fleet holds
# all three of the task's local copy, the request, and the request's exact head.
#
# It DELEGATES rather than deciding. bin/fm-attest.sh remains the only thing
# that reads the pipeline's run record, binds a note to the head that run
# validated, publishes it, and asks GitHub to re-derive the verdict; nothing
# here manufactures, transfers, relabels or infers an attestation, and a
# candidate whose run never covered this head is refused by that owner exactly
# as it would be anywhere else. The gate is not weakened by publishing evidence
# it would have accepted anyway.
#
# `required` is asked first and separately, because it is a read of files and
# costs nothing, while the publication that follows talks to a forge. A
# repository that reads no attestation is left completely alone: this is the
# predicate that lets the step be unconditional here without touching a project
# that never asked for it.
#
# Three-valued, and never fatal. Arming the watch has already succeeded above
# and a provenance answer must not be able to undo it, so every outcome is
# reported and none changes this script's exit status. The bound below is on
# this whole delegation, because a forge that will not answer must not hold a
