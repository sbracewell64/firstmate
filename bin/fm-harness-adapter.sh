# fm-harness-adapter.sh - the ONE owner of firstmate's per-harness turn-end and
# busy-state ARTIFACT set: which files each adapter's wiring writes, and
# therefore which files teardown must remove.
#
# This mirrors bin/fm-backend.sh + bin/backends/<name>.sh on the harness axis:
# a BACKEND is the session provider a task runs inside (tmux, herdr, zellij,
# orca, cmux), while a HARNESS is the agent CLI running inside it (claude,
# codex, opencode, pi, pi-signed, grok, kimi).
#
# Scope note: this file owns the artifact INVENTORY only. The semantic
# busy-state contract - what busy means, which source is trusted for which
# harness, and how records are classified - is owned by bin/fm-busy-lib.sh and
# is deliberately not duplicated or re-litigated here.
#
# Why it exists. bin/fm-spawn.sh installs a per-harness wiring file, and
# bin/fm-teardown.sh removes it - but the removal list was written out by hand
# in SIX places (four worktree `rm -f` blocks, two state-dir blocks) plus a
# seventh spelling in the dirty-check allowlist, with nothing forcing them to
# agree. They drifted, and the drift is not hypothetical:
#
#   OpenCode's wiring file was renamed .opencode/plugins/fm-turn-end.js ->
#   .opencode/plugins/fm-busy-state.js. Two of the four worktree blocks were
#   updated; the orca-child path and the ORDINARY task path were not. Both
#   still remove the old name, which fm-spawn no longer writes, so on the
#   ordinary teardown path an OpenCode task cleaned nothing at all and left the
#   plugin in a worktree that treehouse then returned to the pool. The
#   busy-state `gen` guard (bin/fm-busy-lib.sh) keeps a leaked plugin from
#   classifying a later task, so the damage is a leaked untracked file plus a
#   dirty-check refusal risk on the next teardown, not a false busy verdict.
#
# Consolidating the list here is what stops that recurring: install and every
# removal path now read the same data, so a renamed or added artifact cannot be
# updated in one place and forgotten in six.
#
# Removal is deliberately the UNION across every known harness, not just the
# task's recorded one. That matches the behavior teardown always had, and it
# stays correct for a task whose recorded harness is missing, unreadable, or no
# longer matches what actually ran. Installation is per-harness, because only
# the launching adapter knows what it wrote.
#
# Sourcing this file loads every adapter in bin/harnesses/ (see "adapter
# loading" at the foot of the file). It has no other side effects: nothing is
# written and no external command is run.

#                                          These are what fm-spawn writes and

#   FM_HARNESS_<NAME>_STATE_ARTIFACT_SUFFIXES  per-task filename SUFFIXES; each
#                                          state artifact is the task id
#                                          followed by one suffix, RELATIVE to

# magnitude larger and most consumers touch only one.

# rather than run with an empty artifact list, which would silently make
# teardown remove nothing.
