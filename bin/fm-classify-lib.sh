# Shared wake classifier: the common source of truth for captain-relevant status
# tests, declared-external-wait vocabulary, the captain-gated-versus-external pause
# kind, and the working/paused absorb classification that makes no-verb signal and
# stale-pane wakes safe to absorb.
# Sourced by BOTH the always-on watcher
# (bin/fm-watch.sh) and the away-mode daemon (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh) so the
# overlapping triage policy lives in one place instead of two copies that can
# drift apart.
#
# Most functions are pure, side-effect-free reads of status files: each takes
# what it needs as arguments and touches no globals beyond the optional
# FM_CAPTAIN_RE override. Consumers layer their own dedup/marker state on top (the
# daemon keeps its escalation-digest seen-markers; the watcher keeps its .seen-*
# signatures).
#
# There are three documented exceptions. task_hold_kind reads the backlog
# through its own tool; see its own comment for the callers' cost contract.
# The absorb classification
# (crew_absorb_class and its working/paused wrappers) is NOT a pure status-file
# read: it reuses bin/fm-crew-state.sh, which may make a bounded no-mistakes call,
# to decide whether a crew that just stopped its turn or went stale is working,
# deliberately paused, settled in a terminal state, or none of those. Callers run
# it ONLY on no-verb signal handling, first sighting of a stale hash, and
# immediately before escalating a possible wedge - never on every wake - so the
# per-wake triage stays cheap. status_open_decisions_incremental (see "incremental (cursor-backed)
# open-decisions fold" below) also writes: it persists a per-status-file byte
# cursor and folded open-set as a side effect, so a per-drain fleet-wide scan
# stays bounded by new appends instead of re-reading each task's whole lifetime
# log every time.

# --- backend-pushed blocked-on-human stale wakes ----------------------------
#
# A push-capable backend can report an agent-state edge to `blocked` - the
# harness stopped for a human prompt (a permission dialog, a trust prompt, an
# interactive menu). bin/fm-transition-lib.sh's policy table is the one owner of
# that classification, and the producer already applies EDGE-triggered dedupe on
# agent state: one wake per `->blocked` edge, cleared by the next `->working`
# edge. The wake therefore arrives pre-deduplicated, and the ordinary stale
# path's STATUS-LINE dedupe must not be layered on top of it. A task correctly
# parked on a captain decision has an unchanged terminal status line by
# definition, so keying on status text absorbs every block after the first and
# the worker waits on a prompt nobody sees. Keying a second time on agent state
# would duplicate the producer's dedupe in a second owner instead.
#
# The two functions below are the ONE owner of that wake's detail grammar: the
# producer builds the detail with stale_detail_blocked_on_human and every
# consumer recognizes it with stale_detail_is_blocked_on_human, so neither side
# spells the text itself and a reworded producer cannot silently stop being
# exempt. The invariant suffix carries the meaning; the backend and agent-state

# A captain-gated wait cannot - it clears only when the captain acts, and the

#
# The backlog already records exactly this distinction per work item as hold_kind
# (captain|external|load|parked|future), so these read that existing vocabulary
# instead of parsing pause prose or inventing a parallel one.
#
# NOT a pure read: task_hold_kind shells out to the backlog reader in FM_HOME, the

# Every other verdict keeps it. `parked` and `blocked` are the gate itself.
# `aborted` and `interrupted` are run-level, not task-level: the run stopped
# without judging the work and the deliverable that would justify clearing does
# not exist yet. `stale` and `unknown` are the absence of a reliable read, and an

# --- durable keyed decisions ------------------------------------------------
#
# The status stream is an append-only EVENT log. Reading it last-event-wins

# after a later, unrelated event": a subsequent done/paused/working line silently
# masks a still-open needs-decision. status_open_decisions is the ONE authoritative
# statement of the status-fold contract that fixes this - a needs-decision/blocked
# line OPENS a keyed decision, and only an explicit resolution or a verified
# captain-held backlog transfer referencing that key CLOSES it; a later unrelated
# terminal line never clears an open captain decision.
# Who WRITES the closing line is owned elsewhere: the answering firstmate closes
# at answer time through fm-send's --resolve-key (bin/fm-send.sh header), and a
# worker self-closes only a blocker that cleared without an answer (bin/fm-brief.sh
# rule 6), so closure never depends on a busy worker's discipline.
#
# Decision key grammar (backward-compatible with the existing "<verb>: <note>"
# format): an OPTIONAL "[key=<slug>]" token sits between the verb and the colon,
#   needs-decision [key=api-shape]: <summary>
#   resolved       [key=api-shape]: <how it was decided>
# A line with no token uses the key "default", preserving the historical
# one-open-decision-per-task behavior (a bare "resolved:" closes "default").
# A typed event carries the same key as its `key=` field.
#
# The three parsers below are pure reads of a single line; on a prose line the
# verb parser strips any key token before the colon so the leading word is
# recovered cleanly.
# All three accept BOTH forms, which is the whole migration mechanism:
# every consumer in bin/ already reads status lines through them, so teaching
# them the envelope taught the fleet at once, and a home part-way through the
# migration reads a mixed log correctly. A typed event answers from its fields; a

# set, applying the same needs-decision/blocked-opens, resolved/captain-held-closes
# rule status_open_decisions documents above. Pure text transform, no file I/O.
# This is the ONE place the per-line open/resolved rule is written; both the
# whole-file fold (status_open_decisions) and the incremental cursor-backed fold
# (status_open_decisions_incremental) below call this instead of re-deriving the
# rule, so the two consumption strategies can never drift apart on semantics.
# Reserved decision-key namespaces, and the rule that makes them mean something.
#
# A key like `pending-reply-<id>` names a decision that one library raises and is
# the only thing that ever closes it. Every writer reaches this same stream: a
# local mate appends straight into it, and a remote mate's lines are mirrored
# into it verbatim. So without a rule here, any writer could claim a reserved
# key with an unrelated note, take the key over in this fold, and permanently
# block the owner's close - leaving a decision nothing will ever resolve - or
# clear the owner's decision with a bare resolution.
#
# The rule is deliberately generic, so this fold needs no knowledge of any
# particular owner: a reserved key may only be opened or closed by a line whose
# note speaks that namespace's own vocabulary, which its owner states by
# beginning the note with a `<namespace>...:` token. A line failing that is not a
# decision transition at all here and is folded as ordinary status. This is a
# consumer-side rule on purpose - it protects local and remote writers
# identically, and it can never fail a whole delta or wedge a stream the way a
# writer-side rejection would.

# --- incremental (cursor-backed) open-decisions fold ------------------------
#
# status_open_decisions above re-reads and re-folds a status file's ENTIRE
# lifetime on every call, so its cost grows with total log size. A per-drain
# fleet-wide scan using that whole-file function would pay that cost for every
# task on every wake, which grows unbounded as tasks run longer and accumulate
# status history. status_open_decisions_incremental and scan_open_decisions_incremental
# below are the bounded-cost siblings used for that per-drain path: each call
# reads only the bytes appended to a status file since its own last call (a
# persisted per-file byte cursor) and folds just those new lines into a
# persisted running open-set, via the exact same _fm_decision_fold_line rule
# status_open_decisions uses - so the two strategies can never disagree on what
# is open. Cost is bounded by NEW appends since the last drain, not by the
# status file's total lifetime size.
#
# Correctness invariant (unchanged from the whole-file fold): an open decision
# is dropped ONLY by an explicit resolved/captain-held line for its exact key,
# never by cursor advancement, age, or being buried under later appends - the
# persisted open-set carries every still-open key forward across calls
# regardless of how much new unrelated log content has since been folded in.
#
# The cursor format is `version`, `offset`, `ident`, then the folded open set.
# FM_OPEN_DECISIONS_FOLD_VERSION must be bumped whenever
# _fm_decision_fold_line semantics change, so persisted state from an older
# interpretation is discarded and rebuilt from byte 0.
#
# Cursor invalidation is deliberately minimal, matching how status files are
# ACTUALLY used in this repo: every one is created once (`>`) and only ever
# appended to (`>>`) - never replaced, renamed, or rewritten in place. So the
# ways a cursor can go stale are a fold-version mismatch, a shrink (truncated),
# or the file at this path being a different file than before
# (replaced/rotated/recreated), which a changed device+inode makes an O(1) check
# via a single `stat` call - no content hashing, no re-reading the consumed
# prefix. Any signal falls back to a full re-fold of the whole current file from
# byte 0 - byte for byte what status_open_decisions itself would compute - and
# rewrites the cursor from that clean baseline. A same-inode, same-size,
# in-place byte edit is NOT detected; that is a deliberately accepted gap
# because no code path in this repo ever does that to a status file.
#
# The other real failure mode is OUR OWN read failing (a stat/wc/tail I/O
# error), not a malformed writer: every such read here is checked, and on
# failure this reports the already-trusted persisted set unchanged rather than
# risking a silent invalidation that would wipe it - never a bare "empty" as if
# nothing were open.
#
# Not a pure status-file read: this writes/rewrites the sibling cursor file as a
# side effect (state/.<task>.open-decisions-cursor), the library's second
# documented exception to the pure-read rule after crew_absorb_class. The write
# is atomic (temp file + rename), so a crash between calls leaves either the
# prior cursor or the new one, never a partial one. bin/fm-wake-drain.sh calls
# this only after releasing the wake-queue lock, so a hypothetical race between
# two overlapping drains can at worst redo a little folding work twice - never
# drop an open decision - because a losing writer's offset can only ever be
# equal to or behind an already-recorded byte position, and the next call
# re-derives from whatever offset actually landed on disk.

# --- blocking_on: DERIVED, never declared ------------------------------------
#
# What a task is waiting on is the single most useful fact on this boundary and
# the single one a worker cannot be trusted to report. A worker knows what it
# just did; it does not know whether its own run is still advancing, whether the
# question it asked was already answered, or whether firstmate escalated it. A
# crew that wrote "blocked: waiting on the captain" and then resumed work leaves
# that sentence sitting in the log as a control fact that is no longer true.
#
# So `blocking_on` is DERIVED here, from three inputs the worker does not own:
# its declared VERB, its decision KEY folded against the whole durable stream,
# and the authoritative crew state from bin/fm-crew-state.sh (CFVC-05). A worker
# may not write the field at all - bin/fm-status-event-lib.sh refuses the whole
# event rather than stripping the value, so there is no path by which a crew's
# own words reach this answer.
#
# Declaring a verb is not the self-report this rule forbids. "I asked a question"
# is something the worker genuinely observed; "I am currently blocked on the
# captain" is a claim about the fleet around it. The verb is evidence, and the
# derivation is free to overrule it: proof of work outranks any declaration.
#
# The vocabulary answers "whose move is it":
#   nothing   - provably not waiting on anyone.
#   self      - the worker's own move: a gate it must answer, a run to re-drive.
#   firstmate - firstmate must act. Every crew escalation lands here first, even
#               one destined for the captain, because a crewmate never addresses
#               the captain directly - firstmate applies the authority contract
#               and escalates if it must.
#   captain   - the captain owes a ruling, proven by a verified captain-held
#               transfer rather than by a crew saying so.
#   external  - a declared wait on something outside the fleet.
#   unknown   - could not be observed. Never narrowed into `nothing`: an
#               unobserved answer is not an answer.

# --- process liveness: descendant CPU advancement ---------------------------
#
# Every absorb source below is SEMANTIC: the no-mistakes run step, the status
# log, the harness busy signal. All three correctly read "not working" the
# moment an agent backgrounds a long command and ends its turn - while the real
# work continues in a child process none of them can see. Measured 2026-08-03:
# one crew running the portable suite in the background produced seven
# consecutive false wedge escalations across 42 minutes, each demanding a deep
# inspection, and at least three other crews hit the same pattern while pipeline
# stages ran underneath them.
#
# This adds the missing PROCESS-level evidence ALONGSIDE those sources, never in
# place of them. Two rules keep it from becoming a blindfold:
#
#   1. Identity, never a bare pid. The kernel reissues pids, so a recorded pid
#      routinely resolves to an unrelated live process; `kill -0`, a `/proc/<pid>`
#      directory test and a bare `ps -p` all report that impostor as alive
#      (data/learnings.md records the measured evidence). Every stored sample is
#      bound to the fm_pid_identity of the agent it was taken from, and a sample
#      whose anchor identity no longer matches is discarded, never compared.
#   2. ADVANCEMENT, never existence. A descendant that merely EXISTS is no
#      evidence of work: a hung child would then mask a genuine wedge, trading a
#      false alarm for the far more dangerous silence. Only cumulative CPU that
#      GREW since the previous sample counts.
#
# The agent is resolved from kernel facts, never a vendor process name: the
# task's recorded worktree is the agent's working directory, and the agent is
# the LEADER of the foreground process group on that pane's terminal.
#
# Leader, not the whole group, and that choice is load-bearing. Whether a tool
# subprocess ends up in its parent's process group or its own is entirely a
# harness implementation detail - Claude Code detaches its Bash-tool children
# into a new session, a plain shell leaves a background job in the shell's own
# group and on the shell's terminal. Excluding the whole group would therefore
# make this signal silently measure nothing for any harness that spawns children
# the second way, which is far worse than the cost of the leader rule: where a
# harness does NOT get its own foreground group (a multi-process launcher such
# as pi-signed, or an agent started without `exec`), the second harness process
# is a descendant of the leader and its own CPU is counted. The threshold below
# and the caller's completed-turn bound are what keep that over-inclusion safe.
#
# The LEADER's own utime/stime is deliberately EXCLUDED. That is the agent
# itself working, which the semantic busy contract (bin/fm-busy-lib.sh) already
# owns, and counting it would let an idle agent's rendering jitter - or worse, a
# genuinely looping wedged agent - read as work. What is counted is everything
# below it: every live strict descendant's CPU, plus every already-reaped
# descendant's CPU through the leader's own cutime/cstime. That sum is monotonic
# across a child exiting (the child's total leaves the live set and lands in its
# parent's cutime), so one aggregate is enough and no per-child bookkeeping is
# needed - which is also what makes a long run of short-lived children, such as
# a test suite driving one script after another, register as advancing at all.
#
# A Linux-compatible /proc is required. Where it is absent this reports `none`,
# which is exactly today's no-evidence behaviour: the wake surfaces.

# Kernel ticks of descendant CPU that must accrue between two samples before a
# crew counts as working. A tick is 10ms at the standard Linux USER_HZ of 100,
# so the default is one full CPU-second per sample: far above what a harness
# helper being spawned and reaped costs incidentally, and far below any real
# build, test run, or pipeline stage. At the watcher's default 15s poll that is
# roughly 7% of one core sustained.
