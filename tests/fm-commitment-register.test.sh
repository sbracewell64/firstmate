# Behavior tests for bin/fm-commitment-register.sh - the typed register of
# recorded-but-not-yet-real commitments, and the pinned decision-file probe.
#
# The cases that carry the weight are the properties the register exists for, and
# each is paired with the control that proves it is not vacuous:
#
#   - RED-CAPABLE. An entry whose commitment is unmet is surfaced and cannot
#     report all-clear; then the probe is SATISFIED and the same entry, byte for
#     byte, retires on its own. A register that only ever says "unmet" enforces
#     nothing, and one that needs a hand edit to go quiet is the defect it
#     replaces - so both directions are driven, and the entry file is checksummed
#     across the transition to prove nothing edited it.
#   - THREE VALUES. could-not-observe is proven distinguishable from BOTH
#     enforced and unenforced, because collapsing it into either is the type error
#     this whole mechanism is built on.
#   - A HAND-WRITTEN STATUS WORD CANNOT SATISFY AN ENTRY. An entry asserting its
#     own state is refused outright, and the refusal is loud rather than a silent
#     drop.
#   - THE FOUR MEASURED FAILURE SHAPES are each expressed as a real entry against
#     the real repository, so the schema is shown to cover them rather than
#     asserted to. Each shape's entry has to probe the thing the shape is ABOUT:
#     a probe that would answer the same whatever the repository said would prove
#     the schema can hold a string, not that it covers the failure. Shape 3 - the
#     derived-state row that went stale while being trusted - reads UNMET here,
#     because the row it names is in fact still stale; its control is the same
#     probe kind over a row that IS owned, which reads SATISFIED.
#   - A VERDICT NEVER CLAIMS MORE THAN THE PROBE OBSERVED. An entry whose recorded
#     commitment has a half no probe reaches declares that half, and cannot retire
#     on the covered half alone.
#   - THE PINNED PROBE BLOCK. Every tier of the 2026-08-10 ruling is driven to its
#     own outcome, including the no-back-fill rule for decisions ruled before it.
#   - THE PROBE-RESULT CACHE NEVER SERVES AN OLD ANSWER AS A CURRENT ONE. It is
#     driven both ways: a served result carries its observation time, and the
#     truth it is standing in for is shown to differ from it.
#

#
# Read precisely: no probe of the kind that is a TRUST decision. Two kinds live
# here and they are not the same question. The register's own typed probes are a
# closed, audited, 10s-bounded set this repository owns, so running one is a cost.
# A decision file's `run:` is arbitrary text from whoever authored a ruling,
# executed by bash -c inside a task worktree, so running one is a trust decision -
# and the chain that reaches it is real: bin/fm-session-start.sh runs
# bin/fm-admission.sh, which runs bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh, which folds every
# task's open decisions, which reaches the closure gate.
#
# This case drives the register end of that chain: with the guard on, no `run:`
# executes, and - the half that matters more - nothing is ACCEPTED either, neither
# from a run nor from a stored verdict. Each half is paired with the control that
# shows the probe really would have run and really would have closed the key.
# tests/fm-session-start.test.sh drives the whole composed chain against the real
# script, including that typed probes still run there.
