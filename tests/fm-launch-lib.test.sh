# tests/fm-launch-lib.test.sh - bin/fm-launch-lib.sh, the single owner of every
# firstmate launch command.
#
# Why this file is load-bearing: a hand-copied launch command has already
# drifted once, dropping claude's CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false
# prefix - the ghost-text suppression that keeps firstmate from reading
# predicted-prompt text as real typed input when it captures a pane. So this
# suite pins two things:
#
#   1. Every crewmate/scout/secondmate template composes exactly what it did
#      before the extraction out of bin/fm-spawn.sh (behavior-preserving pin).
#   2. bin/fm-spawn.sh takes every launch decision from this library - it
#      cannot launch without it and follows a swapped one - so there is
#      exactly one copy to keep verified.
#
# The `primary` kind (a firstmate PRIMARY session: no task, no worktree, no
# brief, no status file) is pinned here too, so the fleet launcher inherits the
# same verified commands instead of hand-writing them.
