# the whole suite to a shared fake that returns the same inert verdict every

# whatever ambient TMUX_PANE/HERDR_ENV the CURRENT dev/CI shell happens to carry
# for the duration of that one call only, so these tests are deterministic
# regardless of what runtime backend is running this test suite itself.
