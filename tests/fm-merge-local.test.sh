# Tests for bin/fm-merge-local.sh's working-tree collision guard: the approved
# local-only landing path must refuse only where the fast-forward could actually
# destroy uncommitted operator work, never on uncommitted entries it provably
# cannot touch. A blanket "dirty tree refuses" check is self-deadlocking - it
# blocks the very commit that would settle those entries - so precision here is
# what keeps the guard usable, and refusing every genuine collision is what keeps
# it safe.
#
# Several cases also pin an ordering the guard depends on: a refusal that can name
# the state it found runs before any generic wrong-branch or divergence complaint,
# because a half-finished git operation produces both of those symptoms and
# neither switching branches nor rebasing is what settles it.
#
# Matrix:
#   refuses  (a) modified path the fast-forward changes
#   refuses  (b) modified path the fast-forward removes
#   refuses  (c) untracked file at a path the fast-forward adds (name with spaces)
#   refuses  (d) untracked file nested inside an otherwise untracked directory,
#                which a collapsed status listing would hide
#   refuses  (e) untracked directory git will not descend into, which arrives as a
#                lone collapsed entry even with untracked files listed in full
#   refuses  (f) untracked file sitting where the fast-forward needs a directory
#   refuses  (g) untracked files under a path the fast-forward replaces with a file
#   refuses  (h) either endpoint of a staged rename that the fast-forward removes
#   refuses  (i) both endpoints of an INCOMING rename, whose diff record orders
#                old-then-new, the reverse of git status
#   refuses  (j) the destination of an INCOMING copy, when the project has asked
#                git for copy detection
#   refuses  (k) an intent-to-add path the fast-forward also adds
#   refuses  (l) an unresolved merge conflict (state it cannot classify)
#   refuses  (m) a merge left in progress with its resolution staged, in a linked
#                worktree, where the git dir is not <project>/.git
#   refuses  (n) a cherry-pick left in progress with its resolution staged
#   refuses  (o) a multi-commit cherry-pick whose conflicted pick has already been
#                resolved and committed, so only the sequencer still says it is
#                open - and whose commit advanced the default branch past the task
#                branch, so the named refusal has to come before the fast-forward
#                check to be reachable
#   refuses  (p) a conflicted rebase, which detaches HEAD, so the named refusal
#                has to come before the default-branch check to be reachable
#   refuses  (q) a conflicted apply-backend rebase, which leaves the same state
#                directory git am uses but without its marker
#   refuses  (r) a failed git am, which keeps HEAD attached and needs the git am
#                commands rather than the rebase ones
#   refuses  (s) an unrecognized git status code
#   proceeds (t) untracked file at a path the fast-forward never touches
#   proceeds (u) modified path the fast-forward never touches
#   proceeds (v) an intent-to-add path the fast-forward never touches
#   proceeds (w) ignored file, even at a path the fast-forward adds
#   proceeds (x) clean tree
#   proceeds (y) a staged rename at paths the fast-forward never touches, proving
#                the rename's second NUL field is consumed and not misread as the
#                next record's status code
#   proceeds (z) a project whose root holds an entry named like its default
#                branch, which git reads as a filename without a '--' separator
#   regression (aa) the observed deadlock: two untracked operator files plus one
#                modified tracked pointer that the incoming commit removes from
#                the index. It must refuse, naming only the pointer, and must
#                merge once that single path is settled - the cure can no longer
#                be locked behind the symptom.
