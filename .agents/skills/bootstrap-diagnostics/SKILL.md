description: >-
  Agent-only handling playbook for session-start bootstrap diagnostics.
  Use whenever the session-start digest's bootstrap or network-checks section prints an actionable diagnostic line - MISSING, MISSING_MANUAL, BACKEND_INVALID, NEEDS_GH_AUTH, TANGLE, STARTUP_MEMORY_BUDGET, CREW_DISPATCH invalid, MODEL_REGISTRY, MODEL_PRICE, MODEL_VERIFY, ADMISSION_CONTROL, WAKE_LEDGER, FLEET_SYNC, NETWORK_CHECKS, PR_CHECK_MIGRATION, VALIDATION_DAEMON, SECONDMATE_SYNC, SECONDMATE_LIVENESS, SECONDMATE_HANDOFF, NUDGE_SECONDMATES, or FMX - or when a standalone bin/fm-bootstrap.sh or bin/fm-startup-network.sh run prints one of those lines.
  A silent bootstrap section, or a BOOTSTRAP_INFO fact, means no skill load.

# bootstrap-diagnostics

Handle each printed line as below, before dispatching work that depends on it.
The line formats themselves are owned by `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh`'s header; this playbook owns the response to actionable lines.
The inline rules in `AGENTS.md` section 3 still bind: detect, then consent, then install - never install anything the captain has not approved in this session - and no work is dispatched until the tools it needs are present and GitHub auth is good.
When any diagnostic needs captain attention, report the plain consequence and requested action using `AGENTS.md` section 9's captain-facing translation contract; do not name the diagnostic label unless the captain needs to paste it into a command or issue.

- `MISSING: <tool> (install: <command>)` - list the missing tools to the captain with a one-line purpose each plus the printed install commands, wait for consent (one approval may cover the list), then run `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh install <approved tools...>`.
  For `treehouse`, this also covers an installed version whose `treehouse get` lacks `--lease`; treat it as an upgrade request.
  For `no-mistakes`, this also covers an installed version older than 1.31.2, because crewmate validation briefs delegate gate mechanics to no-mistakes' version-matched guidance.
  For any axi-family tool - `gh-axi`, `lavish-axi`, `tasks-axi`, `quota-axi` - an installed version below its floor is a plain upgrade request; [`bin/fm-bootstrap.sh`](../../../bin/fm-bootstrap.sh) owns the floor policy, and never argue the floor down to whatever the home happens to have installed.
  For `tasks-axi`, this additionally covers an installed build that fails the separate feature probe (`bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh` owns the definition); `config/backlog-backend=manual` only suppresses the verbose `BOOTSTRAP_INFO: tasks-axi available` fact, not this missing-tool report.
  For `quota-axi`, bootstrap requires it because firstmate reads its current output directly before resolving every crew-dispatch profile array; without it, report the missing requirement and do not choose around an unexamined candidate.
- `MISSING_MANUAL: <tool> (instructions: <url>)` - tell the captain why the tool is required and give them the printed instructions URL, but do not pass the tool to `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh install`; wait for the captain to complete the manual installation, then rerun session start to confirm the dependency is present.
- `BACKEND_INVALID: <name> (known: <names>)` - the resolved runtime backend has no verified dependency or lifecycle contract, so do not dispatch work until the invalid `FM_BACKEND` or `config/backend` value is corrected to one of the listed backends.
- `NEEDS_GH_AUTH` - ask the captain to run `! gh auth login` (interactive; you cannot run it for them).
  This probe now arrives from the deferred network stage, so it is also how an unreachable network shows up: `gh` cannot validate its token offline and reports the same failure. Confirm reachability before asking the captain to re-authenticate a credential that may be fine.
- `NETWORK_CHECKS: <what did not complete>; rerun <command>` - the deferred network stage itself could not finish, so the checks it names are simply unknown, not failed.
  Rerun the printed command; it is idempotent and re-derives every finding.
  A `hit the ...s bound` line means one of those checks is slow or unreachable - most often a remote secondmate host - and the stage stopped rather than letting it wedge; a `lock was no longer held` line means the session that asked for the sweeps no longer owns them, so leave them to the session that does.
- `TANGLE: <remediation>` - the primary checkout is stranded on a feature branch instead of its default branch; `AGENTS.md` section 8 explains why this guard exists and what it protects.
  The work is safe on that branch ref; restore the primary to its default branch with the printed `git -C <root> checkout <default>`, then re-validate that branch in a proper worktree.
  This is the only sanctioned firstmate-initiated git write to the primary, and it is a non-destructive branch switch that strands nothing.
- `STARTUP_MEMORY_BUDGET: invalid config/startup-memory-budget - <reason>` - the visible startup-memory budget is not a safe one-line positive decimal file; do not infer the default or propagate it.
  Correct the local primary file, then rerun session start so the normal convergence path can deliver the validated value to secondmate homes.
- `CREW_DISPATCH: invalid config/crew-dispatch.json - <reason>` - the optional dispatch profile file exists but failed low-cost bootstrap validation; stop profile-based dispatch, report the actionable error, and require correction of the malformed schema, unverified harness name, or invalid harness/effort pair rather than falling back around it or selecting a bad profile.
- `MODEL_REGISTRY: invalid config/models.json - <reason>` - the model registry exists but failed schema validation, so every provider-prefixed model is now refused at spawn until it is corrected.
  Fix the registry; never delete it to clear the error, because deleting it silently disables zero-budget enforcement rather than restoring it.
- `MODEL_REGISTRY: <model> <problem>` - the dispatch config and the registry disagree: the model is unregistered, carries a non-approved status, or has no current live-probe record.
  This is the check that catches a bad model before any worker is launched against it, so correct the dispatch rule or complete the model's admission; do not weaken the check to make the line go away.
- `MODEL_REGISTRY: no config/models.json, ...` - routed provider models exist but nothing enforces the zero-budget rule for them.
  This is a standing gap rather than a failure, and it stays inert by design; raise it with the captain rather than treating it as a startup blocker.
- `MODEL_PRICE: <model> ... no longer zero` - an allowlisted model is no longer free at its provider, which is the exposure a name-only allowlist cannot see.
  Suspend that route immediately, then re-verify its cost class before it is routed to again.
- `MODEL_PRICE: <model> price drifted ...` or `... catalogue source is unreadable` - re-verify the cost class and update the recorded price, or repair the declared catalogue path so the check stops being blind.
- `MODEL_VERIFY: <model> ...` - a live probe failed. Load `model-onboarding` and read the shape before reacting: a provider refusal means this account can never use that model and it must leave routing, while a local failure is a configuration error on this machine and not a provider fact.
- `ADMISSION_CONTROL: invalid config/crew-dispatch.json _scheduling.admission_control - <reason>` - the optional fleet-admission policy exists but failed schema validation, so the fleet's admission layer cannot resolve a band.
  Do not dispatch new work in this home until the named field is corrected; an unknown field is refused rather than ignored precisely so a typo cannot silently disable a safety condition.
  `docs/configuration.md` "Fleet admission control" owns the schema, and `fleet-admission` owns what firstmate does with a resolved band.
- `WAKE_LEDGER: <n> outcome record(s) join no wake record` - that many recorded supervision costs point at a wake this home never drained, so every figure drawn from the ledger overcounts by up to that number.
  Treat it as a measurement defect, never as supervision work: report the count rather than any rate or total computed from the file, until the captain decides what to purge.
  The records are append-only evidence, so never rewrite or migrate the file to clear the count; `bin/fm-wake-ledger.sh reconcile` restates it on demand and that script owns the join.
  A count that grows during a session means something is still recording against unresolvable sequences, which is a bug to escalate rather than a backlog of old damage.
- `WAKE_LEDGER: the wake ledger could not be read ...` - the file exists but could not be opened, so the count above is unavailable rather than zero.
  Repair its permissions or path before quoting any supervision-cost figure; an unreadable ledger is reported precisely so it cannot pass as a clean one.
- `FLEET_SYNC: <repo>: skipped: <reason>` - a benign one-off skip (offline, no origin, local-only); bootstrap continued, investigate only if it blocks work.
  A skip can also report the bounded fleet-refresh timeout (`FM_FLEET_SYNC_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT`, or a fleet-size-aware default with a 20 second floor); a timeout never blocks startup.
- `FLEET_SYNC: <repo>: recovered: <detail>` - the clone had drifted onto a clean detached HEAD holding no unique commits and the sync self-healed it (re-attached the default branch and fast-forwarded); no action needed, it is reported only so the self-heal is visible.
- `FLEET_SYNC: <repo>: STUCK: on <state>, N commits behind <base> - needs attention` - the clone is dirty, on a non-default branch, detached with unique commits, or diverged, so the sync left it untouched (never forcing or discarding); it will keep falling behind until you look.
  A loud STUCK, especially a growing N across bootstraps, means that clone needs hands-on attention; dispatch a crewmate or resolve it before it strands work.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: canonical polls rebuilt and armed; resume supervision for this home` - the non-executing migration rebuilt canonical task polls from validated metadata, and those polls are already armed.
  Independently verify the private per-task outcome record, then resume the emitted supervision protocol after finishing the session-start wake handling.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: validated replacement polls armed; resume supervision for this home` - a retry proved canonical publication provenance, metadata identity binding, and single-link integrity for a replacement poll resolving an earlier ambiguous migration outcome.
  Independently verify the private per-task outcome record, then resume the emitted supervision protocol after finishing the session-start wake handling.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: quarantined polls remain unarmed; review state/.pr-check-migration.log before rearming` - one or more ambiguous or invalid task polls were quarantined without execution and remain unarmed.
  Read the private mode-`0600` per-task outcome record, verify the task's recorded PR independently, and rearm only through `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` with canonical inputs.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: migration completed safely; resume supervision for this home` - migration crossed the update boundary without rebuilding or quarantining a task poll after pausing the prior watcher.
  Resume the emitted supervision protocol after finishing the session-start wake handling.
- Any other `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION:` refusal means migration did not complete safely, whether because watcher exclusion, a private path, a diagnostic, quarantine validation, or marker publication could not be proved.
  Keep each affected poll unavailable, inspect the named private state path, and do not bypass the migration or execute a quarantined artifact; a completed safe-scan marker allows unrelated authenticated polls to continue while private repair remains pending.
- `VALIDATION_DAEMON: down - <evidence>` - the shared no-mistakes validation daemon is not running, so no task can be validated and every pipeline already waiting on it is stalled.
  When the line carries a `last active` duration, use that as the outage length; the clause is deliberately absent when bootstrap has no daemon-log timestamp from which to measure it.
  Starting it is firstmate's decision and never an automatic one: the daemon's own startup recovery fails every run it cannot resume, so reconcile each task's real validation state after any start rather than trusting a pre-outage record.
  Report the stall and any measured outage length to the captain under `AGENTS.md` section 9 before dispatching work that depends on validation.
- `VALIDATION_DAEMON: unknown - cannot read a pid from <path>` - the daemon's pid file is present but no pid can be read out of it, so liveness is genuinely unmeasured.
  Do not treat this as down and do not treat it as alive: inspect the named path, and settle the daemon's actual state before either alarming the captain or dispatching validation-dependent work.
- `SECONDMATE_SYNC: secondmate <id>: skipped: <reason>` - secondmate convergence left a live home on its existing checkout because the home was dirty, diverged, unsafe, on the wrong branch, missing its placement-specific target commit, unreachable, or otherwise not fast-forwardable, or because inherited local-material propagation failed; bootstrap continued, but inspect the reason because the secondmate's tracked instructions, inherited settings, or shared captain preferences may be stale after a primary update.
- `SECONDMATE_LIVENESS: secondmate <id>: skipped: <reason>|respawn failed after <cause>: <reason>` - the session-start liveness sweep could not guarantee that the registered secondmate is running a real agent process.
  Investigate the reason because that secondmate is not guaranteed live.
- `SECONDMATE_HANDOFF: secondmate <id>: pending delivery: <n> item(s)` - queued work has already left the main dispatchable backlog and remains safe in the named remote route's backlog-format outbox.
  Preserve that outbox and rerun `bin/fm-backlog-handoff.sh --resume-pending` after same-host connectivity returns; never re-add or dispatch the items from the main backlog.
  An unsafe-outbox variant requires path and file-type inspection before any retry.
- `NUDGE_SECONDMATES: secondmate <id>: send failed: <reason>` - secondmate convergence changed a running home's loaded instructions or inherited config, but the deterministic `fm-send.sh fm-<id>` re-read nudge failed.
  Inspect the reason, keep the pending marker under `state/.secondmate-nudge-pending/` intact, and rerun session start after the endpoint or metadata issue is fixed so bootstrap can retry the exact same marked send on the same local or remote route.
- `FMX: X mode on ...` / `FMX: X mode off ...` - bootstrap confirmed or removed the local Relay poll artifacts (`docs/configuration.md` "Relay (.env)"); the emitted line still carries Relay's former `X mode` wording.
  Only when a running watcher needs the cadence transition applied immediately, restart the home-scoped watcher through the emitted harness supervision protocol; bootstrap deliberately never restarts the watcher itself.
